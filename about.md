Hi I'm Stephanie Farn! I'm a senior majoring in game design and minoring in comsci. 

### More Information

Besides coding I really enjoy playing the piano and drawing (primarily character design). I don't think I could pick a favorite game, but I've played far too much Splatoon, Fire Emblem and Genshin.
